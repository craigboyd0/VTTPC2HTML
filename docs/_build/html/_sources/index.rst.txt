This project is for supporting the PC2HTML application.  This application converts an exported PC XML file from Fantasy Grounds Unity to a more readable HTML format.  From there you could print the file to paper or print it to a PDF or what have you.
Review the usage section to see how you walk through exporting your character and using the program to convert it to HTML.
This application is written in Xojo (https://xojo.com)
